Instead, you can just open the Gallery app. Your screenshots will be stored in the &lsquo;Screenshots&rsquo; album. Additionally, you can use the File Manager app to search in the Pictures folder which contains the screenshots taken on your device. You can also access the screenshots from the Google Photos app which you can set to backup all your photos and videos in the cloud. Moreover, if you have enabled USB debugging, you can get the screenshots off the device onto your computer. All of these are the quickest and easiest ways to access and store your screenshots.</p><h3 id=1-taking-screenshots-without-the-power-button-on-samsung-a13>1. Taking Screenshots without the Power Button on Samsung A13<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-taking-screenshots-without-the-power-button-on-samsung-a13>#</a></h3><p>Screenshots can be incredibly useful, as they provide a way to capture what&rsquo;s currently displayed on your Samsung A13&rsquo;s screen. But how do you take a screenshot without the power button?</p><p>Fortunately, Samsung has built in their own shortcut to take screenshots on the A13 without having to power down the device. The first step is to tap and hold the Volume Down and Bixby buttons simultaneously for two seconds. Once the screenshot has been captured, a message will appear in the notification panel confirming that the screenshot was successful.</p><p>Once your screenshot has been taken, it can be easily accessed from your device&rsquo;s Gallery app. To do this, launch the Gallery app and select Screenshots from the list in the left navigation bar. Here you&rsquo;ll find all your screenshots in chronological order, along with the time and date they were taken.</p><p>Finally, Samsung also offers a way to save screenshots directly to your Samsung cloud account. To do this, simply tap the Share icon located on the top right corner of a taken screenshot. Here, you can choose to save the screenshot to your Samsung cloud account. This can be incredibly useful, as it allows easy organization and access to your screenshots from any device that is logged into your account.</p><h3 id=2-finding-your-stored-screenshots>2. Finding Your Stored Screenshots<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-finding-your-stored-screenshots>#</a></h3><p>Finding your stored screenshots can be a bit tricky if you don&rsquo;t know where they&rsquo;re stored. The good news is that most, if not all, Samsung A13 devices have a default folder for screenshots. You can find the folder by going to your phone&rsquo;s Photos app. Tap the menu icon and select Device Folders. From there, you&rsquo;ll be able to open the Screenshots folder and view all of your screenshots. You can also access the Screenshots folder by going to the My Files app, tapping on either the Images or Device Storage folders, and then locating the Screenshots folder within that.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;re in the Screenshots folder, you can select any of the screenshots you&rsquo;ve taken and share, delete, or edit them. You can also select multiple screenshots at once to easily batch share, delete, or edit them. You can also copy the screenshots to a different folder in order to save them in a different location.</p><p>One final tip is that you can also access the Screenshots folder directly from the notification panel when you take a screenshot. When the screenshot is complete, a notification will appear in the notification panel, and you can simply tap on that notification to access the screenshot right away.</p><p>Taking screenshots on a Samsung A13 without the power button is easy once you know where to find your stored screenshots. With these tips, you&rsquo;ll be able to easily find and manage the screenshots you take with your Samsung A13.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/41J6qkS_3ZU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q: How do I take a screenshot on a Samsung A13 without using the Power button?
