Taking screenshots is an essential part of many iPhone uses’ day-to-day activities. However, if your iPhone 6’s home button is broken, it can be difficult to take a screenshot. Fortunately, there are still three easy hacks that can help you take screenshots on an iPhone 6 with a broken home button. Firstly, you can use AssistiveTouch, a feature on all iPhones. Secondly, you can use the X button combination or the volume up button. Lastly, you can use a third-party app to take screenshots. All of this can be done with minimal effort, so you can still take screenshots even with a broken iPhone 6 home button.\n1. Exploring Alternative Methods for Taking a Screenshot For those who own an iPhone 6 with a broken Home button, taking a screenshot may seem daunting. However, it’s actually quite easy to do with the Assistive Touch feature. To enable Assistive Touch, go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Accessibility \u003e Assistive Touch and toggle it on.

Guide to Taking a Screenshot with AssistiveTouch It is becoming more common for iPhone 6 devices to have a broken home button and while this limits some functionality, taking a screenshot is not one of them.
