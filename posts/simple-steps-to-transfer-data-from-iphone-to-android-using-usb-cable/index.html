Check USB Cables Compatibility Transferring data from iPhone to Android can be a daunting task. To make the process easier, you can use USB cables to move data from one device to another. It is important to check whether the USB cables you are using are compatible with both devices. Not all cables are suitable for the transfer, the USB-A or USB-C cables will be needed depending on your devices. To ensure a successful data transfer, you should double-check your cables before starting the process. A USB-A to USB-C cable is needed to transfer data from an iPhone to an Android device.
