Consider angling the document to help eliminate any shadows that may reduce the document’s clarity.\nThirdly, for best results, keep your phone steady while you take the photo. Keep the phone as level as possible and avoid movement while taking the photo.

Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step guide on how to scan documents on Android Samsung phones.
First, open the camera app and switch to the document scanning mode by tapping ‘Document Scan’. Line up the document in the camera viewfinder and adjust the corners of the document to ensure a clear and complete scan.
Then, press the shutter button to capture the document. The scanned document will be automatically saved to the photo gallery. If needed, you can rotate, crop, and adjust the brightness for better quality.
Finally, click ‘Done’ to save the changes and the scanned document will be ready for use. That’s it! You have successfully scanned your documents on your Android Samsung phone.</p><h2 id=3-tips-and-tricks-to-make-the-document-scanning-process-easier>3. Tips and tricks to make the document scanning process easier<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-tips-and-tricks-to-make-the-document-scanning-process-easier>#</a></h2><p>Many smartphone users don&rsquo;t know this, but your Samsung Android smartphone is capable of scanning documents quickly and easily. Here are a few tips and tricks to make the document scanning process easier.</p><p>Firstly, consider using a third-party scanning app such as CamScanner. This app allows you to quickly take a picture of your document, crop it, adjust the levels for contrast and brightness, and then save it as a PDF. It can save you a lot of time compared to using the built-in camera app.</p><p>Secondly, ensure the scanner has enough lighting to clearly see the document. Natural sunlight is usually best, but using a small lamp or the phone&rsquo;s flashlight can also work. Consider angling the document to help eliminate any shadows that may reduce the document&rsquo;s clarity.</p><p>Thirdly, for best results, keep your phone steady while you take the photo. Keep the phone as level as possible and avoid movement while taking the photo. This can help to ensure the document is captured the best it can be.</p><p>Finally, make sure the document is properly framed. Use the phone&rsquo;s camera viewfinder to align the document within the frame to make sure it&rsquo;s captured clearly and completely. With these tips, you&rsquo;ll be able to easily scan your documents using your Samsung Android smartphone.</p><h3 id=1-scanning-documents-with-android-samsung>1.

Thirdly, it&rsquo;s best to save the scanned document in a digital format such as PDF. This not only makes it easier to share, but also eliminates the need for hard copies. Finally, before you hit the scan button, be sure to double-check if everything is in focus.
