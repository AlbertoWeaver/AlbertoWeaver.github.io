You can try contacting your service provider to see if they can help you locate the device.\nQ.5 Is it possible to track a lost phone’s current location instead of its last location? A. Yes, it is still possible to track a lost phone’s current location.

However, thanks to technology, it is now possible to quickly find your phone&rsquo;s last location using Google. Here is a simple step-by-step guide on how to do just that.</p><p>First, open the <a href=https://www.google.com/android/find>https://www.google.com/android/find</a> website in any web browser.

Click on the &lsquo;Secure Device&rsquo; button if you want to lock your device, wipe it clean or show a message on the screen.</p><p>If the approximate location provided by Google is not accurate enough, click the &lsquo;Improve Location&rsquo; button to narrow down its location. You may be presented with an option to mark your phone as lost. This will enable “lock mode”, which will prevent anyone from accessing your device.</p><p>If you can’t find your phone using the above steps, try using the Find My Device app. It will show you the last known location of your phone before its battery died. You can even manage your device remotely if it is still powered on.</p><p>Finally, if you cannot find your device, your carrier can help you get its exact location. Reach out to your carrier&rsquo;s customer service and ask for help for locating your lost phone through the IMEI number.</p><h3 id=ii-using-google-to-find-your-phone>II.

Track Lost Phone&rsquo;s Last Location without Google<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-track-lost-phones-last-location-without-google>#</a></h3><p>Losing a phone can be a very stressful situation. Fortunately, there are other ways in addition to Google to track down the last known location of your phone. One of the best methods is to use a tracking app. Most tracking apps use GPS technology to keep track of where your phone is located. By enabling the app to access your location, you can see your phone&rsquo;s last known location in real-time. Another way to find out where your phone is located is to use your phone&rsquo;s IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number. The IMEI number is a unique number assigned to each phone and can be used to track the last known location of the phone. Lastly, there are several third-party services that provide tracking services for lost phones. These services track your phone using its IMEI number and provide you with its last known location. By using one of these services, you can easily find out the last known location of your lost phone. With these alternative methods, you can easily track down the last known location of your lost phone without using Google.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQGhtHflaAM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q.1 What is the best way to track lost phone’s last location?
