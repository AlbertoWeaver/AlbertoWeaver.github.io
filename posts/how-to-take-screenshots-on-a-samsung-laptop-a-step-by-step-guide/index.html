This will capture just the active window instead of capturing the whole screen.</p><p>Q4: Is there an easier way to take screenshots on a Samsung laptop?
A4: Many newer Samsung laptops have a dedicated &ldquo;Screenshot&rdquo; key on the keyboard. Pressing this key will take a screenshot of the entire screen and save it to your Pictures folder.</p><p>Q5: Can I take a screenshot of a specific area of the screen?
A5: Yes, you can take a screenshot of a specific area of the screen. To do so, press the &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; key + &ldquo;Shift&rdquo; + &ldquo;S&rdquo; at the same time. This will open a screenshot selection tool, allowing you to select the area of the screen you want to capture.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://albertoweaver.github.io/posts/how-to-find-your-lost-phone-on-google-maps/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How to Find Your Lost Phone on Google Maps</span></a>
