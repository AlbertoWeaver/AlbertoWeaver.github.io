Fortunately, with the help of a few tools, the task can be made much easier. To start, you need an adapter that converts the iPhone&rsquo;s lightning connector to a USB-C port. You can then use this USB-C to transfer the photos. Additionally, you can also make use of cloud services such as Google Photos or Dropbox for a more convenient and efficient transfer. With Google Photos, your photos are automatically backed up to the cloud storage, and you can access them from any device. Once you have moved your photos, you should make sure that they are properly formatted for your Android tablet. This usually involves resizing and cropping the images to fit the tablet&rsquo;s display. With these steps, you can easily and quickly transfer your photos from an iPhone to an Android tablet.</p><h2 id=3-finishing-up>3.
